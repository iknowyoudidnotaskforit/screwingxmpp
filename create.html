                        Of course, you need a XMPP account yourself before
                        you can create a XMPP multiuser chatroom. <br>
                        If you do not yet have one, you might like to look
                        at <a href="http://www.jaim.at/server/server_by_gateway_xmpp.html" target="_blank">jaim.at</a>
                        which provides a pretty long server list.<br>
                        A server should feature MUC and (HTTP-)Proxy.
                </p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			To create a XMPP-Chatroom (MUC, Multi User Chat), 
                        log in with you XMPP-Account and
			join a room that has not already been registered. 
                        You will see
			a room has not yet been registered if you are 
                        moderator on
			joining it. This usually is indicated by some 
                        kind of icon or
			text in your client, for example a flag in Pidgin.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			If using Pidgin or Adium, creating a 
                        room works like this:
			<a href="https://itservices.stanford.edu/service/instantmessaging/pidgin/chat"
			target="_blank">Click me (stutorial with screenshots)</a>.
			Note that you do not have to invite contacts like
                        the tutorial describes. You can invite
			them via XMPP or just tell them of the room and 
                        ask them to join it.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			To make the room persistent, you need to configure it.
			Many XMPP clients have graphical tools 
                        to do so. In Pidgin, just join
			the room and type "/config". A window will popup and allow you to 
			configure the room. <br>
			If you have a smaller, private or community related 
                        chatroom, you will most likely want your room to 
                        be persistent, not publically
			searchable and the participant list
			not public. 
                        You can assign a password to the room so 
                        users will be asked
			the password before being able to join. <br>
			XMPP servers usually log chat history for 
                        persistent rooms. Depending on how much history
                        the server stores by default, you'll have to deal 
                        with users reading everything that has been written
                        during the last days when joining, or it may even be
                        so much text joining gets pretty slow.<br>
                        So if there is an option to set the message history
                        to none (to 0 messages, 0 chars, 0 seconds or such)
                        you most likely want to set discussion history to
                        none.<br>
			If you cannot set message history to none, 
                        clear it pretty often by joining
			as an admin and clearing the room messages. 
                        In Pidgin, this is a simple 
			"/clear" and the messages are gone.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			If you want users to be able to join the 
                        room by just clicking a link, you
			might fill out the form below and 
                        create a join-link that will allow everyone
			to join your room.
			<br>
			When you allow non-registered users 
                        to connect, please only specify registered
			rooms for joining: They cannot join non-persistent 
                        rooms on most servers.

				This has advantages concerning security, 
                                but disadvantages concerning compatibility
				(users with other clients will not be 
                                able to join). So only use this if you really need it.
				To use no password, 
                                just leave the field below empty.
